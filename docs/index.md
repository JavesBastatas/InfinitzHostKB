## Pointing your domain to our nameservers

What Is a NameServer? Nameservers help connect URLs with the IP address of web servers. Nameservers are an important part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which many people call the “phone book of the Internet”.
How to change it?

Step – 1: Go to **Domain Management**.

Step – 2: Scroll Down to **Nameservers**.

Step – 3: Enter the nameservers for free hosting, set the NameServers as *dns3.infinitzhost.com* and *dns4.infinitzhost.com*. For Premium hosting, set the nameservers as *dns1.infinitzhost.com* and *dns2.infinitzhost.com*.

Step – 4: Wait for propagation. DNS propagation can take up to a day but It usually takes 20-30 minutes but yours may propagate faster.
